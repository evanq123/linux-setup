# Evan's configs

### Set-up

Follow these steps:
1. install vim and git.
2. run
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziocucci/git-bash-for-mac/master/install.sh)"
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Customize

You don't like the colors of your prompt? Open `~/.git-bash.sh` and mod it.

In addition, by simply exporting a couple of variables in `~/.git-bash.sh` you can make you prompt even more informative:
* if you set `export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1`, unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next to the branch name;
* if you set `export GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE=1` and something is stashed then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name;
* if you set `export GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES=1` and there are untracked files then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.
